# DSRC Project Task List

The active work is a live phone-plus-Jetson advisory system: the phone carries
four sensors and the driver display, the Jetson does all compute, and a sampling
controller on the Jetson adjusts each sensor's rate in real time.

Tasks are sequenced so that **nothing requiring the phone and Jetson to be in the
same room happens until late**. The transport is built with two backends — a
network backend over Tailscale for development, and a USB backend for
deployment — so the whole system can be developed with the phone in hand and the
Jetson wherever it lives. Tasks needing physical colocation are marked
**[COLOCATED]**.

## Architecture

```text
  phone                    transport                  jetson
  -----                    ---------                  ------
  camera --+          network (dev) / USB (car)   +-- perception (TensorRT)
  GPS -----+-- sensor frames ------------------>  +-- fusion (camera + HERE)
  IMU -----+   (each at its own commanded rate)   +-- policy inference
  HERE ----+                                      +-- advisory decode
                                                  |
  display <---- advisory --------------------------+
  rate ctl <--- per-sensor rate commands ----------+-- sampling controller
```

The phone stays dumb: it captures or queries at the commanded rate and forwards
raw data. All interpretation, association, and control live on the Jetson.
The cloud supplies observability through HERE; it is not in the control loop.

## Non-goals

Both devices are powered from the car, so **energy and battery life are not
metrics**. The binding costs for the sampling controller are HERE API quota,
thermal headroom, and Jetson compute. Thermal is a real constraint and the phone
must not overheat.

Out of scope entirely: any traffic-flow effect (one vehicle, advisory-only),
human compliance with the advisory, and anything fleet-level. Those claims come
from simulation or not at all.

## A. Status: what already exists

**Simulator foundation** — maintain, do not rebuild: simulator integration,
project interfaces, the topology ladder, demand and vehicle lifecycle, human
behavior profiles, metrics and logging, local sensing, the common
safety/etiquette/physical-control layer, the baseline ladder, model-free RL.

**Jetson prototype** — reuse rather than rewrite:

- `perception/detector.py`, `tracker.py`, `distance.py`, `observation_builder.py`
- `policy/sim_contract.py`, `actor_runtime.py`, `advisory.py`
- `pipeline.py` tick loop and rolling latency tracking
- `logio/` metadata logging, `eval_run.py` gated reporting

`camera_stream.py` and `gps_reader.py` already abstract their sources and need a
phone backend, not a rewrite. The GPS `dialout` blocker is resolved: the u-blox
enumerates and `/dev/ttyACM0` is readable by `edge`. The Jetson is reachable over
Tailscale at `ssh jetson`, so its runtime can be developed remotely.

## B. Environments

1. ~~Python environment on the Mac with `highway_env`, torch, and the project dependencies.~~ **DONE** — Python 3.12.14 venv at `.venv/`; numpy 2.5.2, torch 2.13.0, gymnasium 1.3.0, highway_env 1.12.1; 138 tests pass. Section C is unblocked.
2. ~~Android toolchain on the Mac.~~ **DONE** — command-line SDK only, no Studio (per plan). Temurin 17.0.20; cmdline-tools; platform-tools, platforms;android-35, build-tools;35.0.0, emulator, system-images;android-31;google_apis;arm64-v8a; AVD `dsrc_test` (Android 12, arm64); Gradle 8.9 wrapper on AGP 8.7.3; `adb` owned solely by the SDK. Plan: `scratchpad/plan_task_02_android_toolchain.md`.
3. ~~`adb` on the Jetson.~~ **DONE** — adb 1.0.41 (platform-tools 28.0.2-debian) at `/usr/bin/adb`, plus `51-android.rules`; 8 packages added, nothing else changed. Carries the `adb forward` TCP tunnel that is the in-car transport (D1). RSA authorization still deferred to task 41. Plan: `scratchpad/plan_task_03_jetson_adb.md`.
4. ~~Tailscale on the phone.~~ **DONE** — `moto-g-power` `100.75.142.126` under `bhardwaj.ankit275@` (same account matters: the Jetson is a *shared* node from `taila2630c`, and sharing is per-account). Phone→Jetson TCP verified with a real payload in both directions; path upgraded DERP→direct, 55 ms. Plan: `scratchpad/plan_task_04_phone_tailscale.md`.

## C. Simulation study — BLOCKED IN SUBSTANCE by the task 8 result

**Tasks 10 and 11 cannot produce meaningful numbers until the simulator can show
a control effect.** The sufficiency study degrades an observation and measures
what the controller loses; the sampling-policy evaluation credits a flow-level
benefit. Both require an effect to degrade or to credit, and task 8 established
there is none — +0.12 to +0.14 m/s where the measurement is cleanest.

**Project-level risk, recorded here deliberately:** the paper's only outcome
claim comes from simulation, and the simulator currently cannot produce one. One
instrumented vehicle can never demonstrate throughput or delay. Repairing the
simulator is therefore a prerequisite for the paper having a result at all, not a
tidying task. It is not scheduled — sections D through G are unblocked and come
first — but it must not be filed as done.

5. ~~Per-field variance audit to identify inert inputs before any ablation.~~
   **DONE** — `src/analysis/observation_audit.py` + `scripts/audit_observation_fields.py`,
   41 tests. Ran 162 conditions (6 topologies × 3 controllers × AV penetration
   {0.05, 0.10, 0.20} × 3 seeds, 120 steps), 10,569 samples.
   Plan: `scratchpad/plan_task_05_variance_audit.md`. Artifacts:
   `outputs/validation/observation_audit/`.

   **Findings that bind sections D–F:**

   - **Only 2 of 39 encoded fields are uninformative everywhere.** `is_active`
     is structurally constant at 1.0 — the observation map contains only active
     AVs, so the flag can never be false. `distance_to_next_merge` is hardcoded
     to `0.0` in `src/sensing/local.py`. Neither should be sensed, and neither
     may be ablated as if the result meant anything.
   - **8 fields are penetration-gated:** dead at 5% AV penetration, informative
     at 20% — `nearby_av_count`, `active_av_count_local`, `nearby_av_density`,
     `nearby_av_lane_distribution.{1,2}`, `downstream_congestion_estimate` and
     its `cooperation.*` twin, and `target_lane_rear_required_decel`. No field
     moves the other way. The local-aggregate cooperation block therefore only
     earns its sensing cost above roughly 10% penetration, which the sampling
     controller (task 29) should treat as a rate-allocation input rather than
     sensing unconditionally.
   - **Inertness is strongly topology-gated:** ring 18/39 constant,
     `straight_single_lane` 14/39, `merge` 8/39, `straight_multilane` 7/39,
     `inverted_tree` 4/39, `inverted_tree_bottleneck` 3/39. Any ablation must be
     read per topology, never pooled.
   - **Coverage caveat:** 60 of 162 conditions produced zero samples — 54 are
     `no_av` (correct by design) and 6 are non-ring topologies at 5% penetration
     where no AV spawns at all. The effective matrix is 102 conditions.
   - **`controlled_vehicles` is inert outside ring.** `HighwayTopologyEnv`
     clears `agent_ids` and defers to the demand spawner whenever continuous
     demand is active, i.e. on every topology except ring. AV population must be
     set through `demand.av_penetration`. This bit the first run and is recorded
     as Amendment 2 in the plan.
6. Sufficiency harness: evaluate a fixed policy under configurable observation
   degradation (field ablation, added lag, added noise, forced fallbacks).
7. Baseline sweep with the current sensing defaults, to establish the reference
   the degraded conditions are measured against.
8. ~~Exercise the topology ladder beyond ring so the study is not
   single-topology.~~ **DONE — superseded by a simulator health check**, which
   absorbed and extended it. `src/analysis/simulator_health.py` +
   `scripts/check_simulator_health.py`, 213 tests. Ran 72 cells / 648 runs
   (6 topologies × 4 demands × 3 penetrations × 3 controllers × 3 seeds, 120
   steps) in 18m37s. Plan: `scratchpad/plan_task_08_simulator_health.md`.
   Artifacts: `outputs/validation/simulator_health/`.

   **Result: 0 of 72 cells pass all four criteria. There is no usable operating
   point, and the simulator cannot currently support a flow-level claim.**

   | criterion | fails in |
   |---|---|
   | `baselines_separate` | 68/72 |
   | `episodes_complete` | 44/72 |
   | `throughput_holds` | 31/72 |
   | `congestion_reachable` | 27/72 |

   - **The controllers have no measurable effect, and crashes are not the
     reason.** Cells that complete separate in 7% of cases, cells that crash in
     5% — the hypothesis that truncation was hiding the effect is refuted. In the
     four cells that both congest *and* complete, measured on 2–3 congested
     shared seeds, the best controller moves mean speed by **+0.12 to +0.14 m/s**
     against a 1.0 m/s threshold. That is the cleanest measurement the grid
     offers and it is near-zero.
   - **Congestion is reachable but topology-structured.** `inverted_tree`,
     `inverted_tree_bottleneck` and `ring` congest in 12/12 cells,
     `straight_single_lane` in 9/12, and **`merge` and `straight_multilane` in
     0/12** — including `merge`/high, which congests at a single penetration but
     fails the per-seed rule.
   - **Only 24 of 216 (cell, controller) pairs were ever measured with a
     congested shared seed.** Most separation failures are therefore not
     evidence that a controller cannot help; the controller was evaluated where
     there was nothing to control. Without `congested_shared_seeds` the report
     would have read as 68 controller failures.
   - **40% of runs crash** (260 of 648 never reach their configured duration).
   - **The penetration axis is substantially noise.** The mechanism is correct —
     pooled realised spawn fraction is 0.200 against a nominal 0.20 — but only
     60–78 vehicles spawn per run, so the standard error is ±0.05 and single-seed
     realised penetration swings between 0.08 and 0.43 at a nominal 0.20. Per-cell
     verdicts rest on single seeds, so nominal 0.05 and 0.10 cells can realise the
     same fraction. Concurrent AV count, which is what actually acts as an
     actuator, peaks at 5–6 out of ~40 active vehicles.
   - **243 of the 648 runs are duplicates.** `burst` is bit-identical to `medium`
     on all six topologies (162 runs), and ring disables demand so its four
     demand levels collapse to one (81 runs). Config defects, out of scope here.

   **Next diagnostic when this is picked up** (not run): raise demand *and*
   episode length *and* penetration together, so concurrent AV count reaches
   double digits. Raising nominal penetration alone would leave the realised
   concurrent count in single figures for the same small-sample reason. That run
   distinguishes "too few actuators" from "these controllers do not control this
   simulator" — two diagnoses leading to completely different work.
9. Sensing model calibrated from drive measurements. *Waits on section G data;
   the harness is built now and the parameters filled in later.*
10. Sufficiency study proper: derive the sensing requirement specification.
11. Sampling policy evaluated in simulation for the flow-level benefit one
    vehicle cannot demonstrate. *Waits on the policy from section F.*

## D. Transport

Two backends behind one interface. Build the network backend first.

**Binding constraint — phone initiates, Jetson listens.** The Jetson cannot
originate ordinary IP traffic to tailnet peers: its Tegra kernel has
`CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK_MARK` unset, so the conntrack struct has no `mark` field and
Tailscale's connmark rules cannot install. The feature is compiled out, not a
missing module, so no package or out-of-tree build fixes it short of rebuilding
NVIDIA's kernel. Inbound works, and both directions were verified on a
phone-initiated TCP connection: sensor data up, advisory and rate commands back
down the same socket. Design the transport so the phone always opens the
connection. This affects the network backend only; the in-car `adb forward` path
tunnels over USB and is unaffected.

12. ~~Transport interface: framed bidirectional messaging, backend-agnostic.~~
    **DONE** — `deployment/jetson/transport/`, stdlib only, 291 tests. Plan:
    `scratchpad/plan_task_12_transport_interface.md`; wire contract:
    `specs/transport_protocol.md`; frozen encodings:
    `specs/transport_golden_frames.json`.

    One socket, channels multiplexed by a JSON header in front of an opaque
    payload; framing, priority, overflow, sessions and counters all sit above a
    three-method `ByteConnection` seam, so tasks 13 and 40 each implement a byte
    stream rather than a transport. The loopback backend ships, so the pipeline
    runs with no phone and no Jetson.

    **Measured.** 291/291 tests pass identically on the Mac (3.12) and on the
    Jetson (aarch64, 3.10). Loopback at the planned sensor rates: every channel
    at its commanded rate, zero drops, zero gaps, transport latency p50 0.02–0.08 ms.
    Over a real Tailscale socket, Mac standing in for the phone, 60 s at
    **428 KB/s (3.4 Mbps)**: camera 10.02 Hz achieved against 10.0 commanded,
    zero outbound drops on any channel, zero sequence gaps, round trip p50
    **11.3 ms** / p95 21.0 ms / p99 70.2 ms, handshake 12.9 ms. The Jetson's own
    per-channel account closes exactly on every channel. All four failure modes
    provoked over the real link and independently confirmed in the listener's
    record: version mismatch refused, `displaced`, `framing_error`, and
    `stalled` at 5.0 s against a 5.0 s timeout — with the listener surviving
    each and serving the next connection.

    **Overflow only appears once the consumer is slower than the offered load.**
    Throttled to 2 Hz against a 10 Hz camera: camera dropped 241 of 300 keeping
    only the newest, IMU 1186 of 1501, GPS 28 of 150, while `advisory` and
    `rate_cmd` dropped nothing and held sub-0.1 ms latency — the priority and
    per-channel policy decisions working as specified.

    **Validation: four rounds, 30 findings, 26 of them defects in the previous
    round's fixes.** Worth reading before task 13 touches this code:
    a caller message carrying a reserved key was destroyed with no counter and
    no gap; one silent peer could wedge the listener for a whole drive; the
    stall timer measured completed frames, so a slow link was killed and would
    reconnect forever; a delivered frame was reported as a loss; a thread dying
    outside its expected exception types left a session claiming to be healthy
    while transmitting nothing; and `delivered` counted arrivals rather than
    collections, so it was always equal to `received` and double-counted
    anything displaced — that last one found by the experiment, not by
    validation, because no test drove inbound overflow and checked the account
    at the same time.

    **Three assumptions only a real socket can break**, documented in
    `connection.py` and untested until task 13: `recv_exact` must raise rather
    than return short or empty (returning `b""` at EOF spun the reader at
    millions of calls per second before it was guarded); `close()` must unblock
    a read already in progress from another thread, or the handshake timeout
    leaks a thread per attempt (counted in `handshake_workers_leaked`, not
    prevented); and a write failure must surface as `OSError`.
13. ~~Network backend over Tailscale, for development with devices apart.~~
    **DONE** — `transport/tcp.py` and `transport/client.py`, plus
    `scripts/run_transport_listener.py` and `scripts/run_transport_client.py`
    which replace the scratchpad tools task 12's experiment ran from. Plan:
    `scratchpad/plan_task_13_network_backend.md`. 431 transport tests.

    Both ends: the Jetson accepts, the phone dials, and a `SessionClient`
    composes dial + handshake + `Session` with reconnection that never gives up.
    Backoff 0.25 s doubling to a 5 s cap with ±25% jitter; the schedule resets
    only after a session lasting `max(cap, stall × 2)`, derived so it cannot
    coincide with the stall timeout — at the shipped 5 s it would have, and the
    escalation would then never have engaged for the commonest failure in a car.

    **Both seams now have conformance suites**, run against every backend, so
    task 40's USB work inherits them: `ByteConnection` (13 checks × 2) and
    `Acceptor` (9 × 2, added after the two implementations disagreed about what
    `accept(timeout=0)` means). An accepted connection is also run through the
    `ByteConnection` checks, because the two suites were disjoint and a USB
    acceptor handing back a non-compliant connection would have passed
    everything.

    **Measured on the Jetson** (Linux 5.15.148-tegra aarch64, Python 3.10.12):
    **431/431 pass**, identical to the Mac. That is the point of running it
    there — two requirements were only ever verified as *call order* on macOS,
    which releases a blocked `recv` on `close()` alone. On Linux:

    ```text
    blocking recv, close() only        never released (still blocked at 6 s)
    blocking recv, shutdown()+close()  released in 0.001 s
    ```

    So `shutdown()` before `close()` is essential there, not belt-and-braces:
    without it a session shutdown leaves its reader blocked forever. The
    platforms disagree the *other* way on `accept`: macOS releases a blocking
    accept but not a timed one, which ran its caller's full 5 s; Linux releases
    both at once. The internal accept poll is what macOS needs and Linux does
    not.

    **Over the real Tailscale link**, Mac standing in for the phone, 60 s at
    **428 KB/s (3.4 Mbps)**: every channel at its commanded rate, **zero drops,
    zero sequence gaps**, round trip p50 27.8 ms / p95 71.7 ms / p99 280 ms,
    and the client process flat at 27 fds and 11 threads sampled through the run
    — the two per-attempt leaks validation found would have shown as a slope.
    All four failure modes provoked and confirmed in the listener's own record:
    version mismatch refused, `displaced`, `framing_error`, and `stalled` at
    5.0 s. A **genuine half-open** — the client process frozen with SIGSTOP, so
    the socket stays open with no FIN, no RST and no application data — was
    reaped as `stalled`. That is the case the timer exists for and no unit test
    can produce.

    **The handshake-timeout question is settled: 5.0 s has roughly 50× margin.**
    Client-side handshake round trip measured 21.5–101.9 ms across runs. Note
    the *listener's* `handshake_round_trip_ns` is **not** the link round trip —
    both sides stamp send-then-read, but the dialler's read waits a full round
    trip while the listener's hello arrives after the client's is already
    queued, so it read 0.3 ms against the client's 101.9 ms on the same session.
    Renamed in the report accordingly.

    **Validation: four rounds, 32 findings**, and the transferable part is that
    the fix was right every time while *what trailed it moved outward each
    round* — round 1 the evidence trailed the code, round 2 the observability
    trailed the evidence, round 3 the consumers trailed the library, round 4 the
    report trailed the question it was built to answer. Worth reading before
    task 40: one silent peer could wedge the accept loop for a whole drive; a
    retryable accept error killed the listener permanently while claiming it was
    closed; a retry with no pause spun at 2.2 M calls/s; a nullable field
    crashed the run report in exactly the interesting case; and a salvage I
    added in round 3 created phantom sessions that inflated `connected` and
    `reconnects`, so I reverted it.

    **The seam question is settled, the other way.** I raised `ByteConnection` as
    one property short — twice this task wanted to ask a connection "are you
    still usable". Checked: nothing consumed the `is_closed` that TcpConnection
    already had, and both problems were already solved without it. So it was
    **removed** rather than added: a liveness flag is stale the moment it is
    read, and check-then-act on one is the exact shape of this task's two worst
    races. The protocol stays at four members, `connection.py` says why there is
    deliberately no liveness query, and the contract suite pins both that every
    member is present and that no undeclared surface appears — so a backend's
    extras are a deliberate act. Task 40 implements four, not five.
14. Wire protocol: sensor messages upstream, advisory and rate commands
    downstream, each carrying its own timestamps.
15. Shared timebase with clock-offset estimation and drift tracking, so
    phone-side and Jetson-side events are comparable.
16. Loopback test with synthetic sensor frames and synthetic advisories;
    transport latency instrumented from the start.

## E. Phone app — phone is in hand, no Jetson needed

17. Android project skeleton: Kotlin, CameraX, permissions, foreground service.
18. Camera capture at the commanded rate, JPEG encode, per-frame monotonic
    timestamps from `elapsedRealtimeNanos`.
19. GPS capture and forwarding, logging both fix time and receipt time.
20. IMU capture and forwarding.
21. HERE client: query around the current position at the commanded rate, forward
    the raw response with request and response timestamps, no interpretation on
    the phone. **Blocked: needs a HERE API key.**
22. Rate-command handling across all four sensors, applied without restarting
    capture.
23. Advisory display: the driver-facing UI.
24. Thermal monitoring reported upstream, plus throttle-safe capture that
    degrades rather than failing.
25. Local session logging on the phone, for ground truth and post-hoc analysis.

## F. Jetson runtime — developed over SSH

26. Phone backends for `CameraStream` and `GpsReader`, fed from the transport.
27. HERE response ingestion: link association from GPS, caching, staleness
    tracking, explicit failure semantics.
28. Fusion / estimator: per-field source ownership between the wide-lagging feed
    and the narrow-current camera, with a staleness aging term. The sources
    observe different parts of the state and are not substitutable.
29. Sampling controller producing four independent rates. Inputs: the free
    always-on IMU/GPS tier as a trigger proxy, advisory bin-boundary proximity,
    disagreement between sources, and thermal backoff from the phone.
30. Shadow / live mode flag. In shadow mode the controller emits the decisions it
    would make without gating; in live mode it gates for real. Both paths
    implemented, flag flippable at runtime.
31. Integration into the existing tick loop, advisory returned to the phone.
32. End-to-end run over the network backend, phone and Jetson apart, exercising
    the whole loop before any USB work.

## G. Instrumentation

Written as part of the implementation, not added afterwards.

33. Per-stage timestamps across the loop: capture, encode, transport, detect,
    track, fuse, infer, decode, return, render.
34. Trigger attribution in the controller: which rule fired, for which sensor,
    and why.
35. Shadow-mode decision log emitted alongside the full-rate reference, so every
    candidate policy can be scored against identical traffic from one drive.
36. Per-tick field provenance and missingness.
37. Thermal and throttle-event log for both devices.
38. Failure event log: GPS dropout, HERE failure or quota exhaustion, dropped
    frames, transport stalls, with recovery outcome.
39. Session summary generator: latency percentiles, achieved versus commanded
    rates, API calls made, trigger counts, failure counts.

## H. Colocation and integration — **[COLOCATED]**

Everything above is done before the devices meet.

40. **[COLOCATED]** USB transport backend behind the same interface, swapped in
    for the network backend.
41. **[COLOCATED]** `adb` first connection: accept the RSA authorization on the
    phone screen, tick "always allow".
42. **[COLOCATED]** Bench loopback over USB with both devices on a desk;
    end-to-end latency measured against the 200 ms target.
43. **[COLOCATED]** Shadow-mode correctness: logged shadow decisions match what
    live gating produces on the same input.
44. **[COLOCATED]** Live-mode verification: flip the flag and confirm gating
    genuinely changes sampling rates, the loop still closes, and the advisory
    remains sane. Shadow mode is not evidence that live mode works.
45. **[COLOCATED]** Thermal soak: sustained maximum-rate run to steady state;
    confirm the phone stays within limits and the controller backs off.
46. **[COLOCATED]** Failure injection: revoke GPS, kill HERE, unplug the link,
    and confirm each degraded mode behaves as specified.
47. **[COLOCATED]** Sim-contract parity: the observation vector produced live
    matches the simulator's sensing model field for field.
48. **[COLOCATED]** In-car install: 12 V power for both devices, mounts, cable
    routing.

## I. Measurement drives — **[COLOCATED]**

49. Shakedown drive: short and local, purely to confirm the system records
    readable, aligned data.
50. Drive set 1, shadow mode at maximum rate: the full-rate reference plus every
    candidate policy's decisions against identical traffic.
51. Drive set 2, live mode: the controller gating for real, verifying the
    shadow-mode predictions held.
52. Repeat across congested and free-flow conditions on at least three separate
    days, on a corridor known to congest.

Measured on the drives: end-to-end and per-stage latency; achieved versus
commanded rates and trigger attribution; HERE-reported speed against experienced
speed, and feed lag; camera-derived local speed variance against the feed's
scalar; how often the camera changes the advisory; provenance and missingness on
real roads; advisory bin distribution and churn; safety-layer intervention
counts; thermal behavior; and failure and recovery events.

## J. Reproducibility

53. One-command dry runs for the simulation matrices.
54. Smoke validation small enough for routine regression testing.
55. Artifact manifest: where checkpoints, session recordings, metrics, plots, and
    validation summaries live.

## Blockers

- **HERE API key** — blocks task 21 only. Everything else in E proceeds.
- **Physical colocation** — blocks section H onward. Nothing before it.
- Repository layout: phone app in `dsrc/android/`, Jetson runtime extends
  `deployment/jetson/`.
